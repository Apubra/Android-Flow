    Etc...

# Today we will discuss about TWRP

First of all we need to unlock our boot.
Go to your mobile and enable the debuging and OME mode.
For that we need SDK install in our pc.
Then open your terminal and following the command-
adb reboot bootloader

fastboot oem unlock

Then you can check your boot device-
fastboot devices

Ok, now boot is unlock.

Then reboot your device-
fastboot reboot


# Install TWRP
Letâ€™s start by downloading TWRP for your device. 
You can find a list of devices that are currently supported by following the link.
